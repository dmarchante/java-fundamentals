## Linter

### Behavior
Checks if the the line in a JS file ends in a semi-colon if it is not empty, does not contain if or else, and does not end with opening or closing curly braces

### Expectation
Should display Line number and missing semicolon message if that line is missing a semicolon, otherwise there is nothing returned
